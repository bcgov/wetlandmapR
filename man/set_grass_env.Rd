\title{Function initializes a temporary GRASS-GIS environment, sets the region
parameters to match those of user provided DEM, writes input
raster to the GRASS environment.}
\usage{
set_grass_env(
  gisbase,
  DEM,
  lyr_list,
  lyr_names,
  acc_thresh,
  seg = F,
  memory_mb = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DEM}{A digital elevation model as a 'raster' object with an 
extent encompassing all pour points of interest. Note, all layers
must match the CRS of this layer.}

\item{lyr_list}{A list of 'raster' objects representing the input 
raster layers that will be written to the GRASS environment.}

\item{lyr_names}{A character vector corresponding to 'lyr_list' defining
the names of each input raster layer.}

\item{acc_thresh}{The accumulation threshold to be passed to 'r.stream.extract'.}

\item{seg}{Should data be segmented to disk to save RAM on resource limited systems,
defaults to FALSE.}

\item{memory_mb}{Maximum memory in MB to allocate if 'seg' is equal to TRUE.}

\item{gisBase}{The directory path to GRASS binaries and libraries, 
containing bin and lib sub directories among others, see rgrass7::initGRASS}
}
\value{
NULL, only initializes and populates a GRASS-GIS environment.
}
\description{
This function relies on 'rgrass7' to initialize and populate a 
temporary GRASS-GIS environment. The user must have GRASS-GIS
binaries installed, and provide the path to these, e.g., "/usr/lib/grass78".
User must provide a DEM, which will be used for subsequent processing,
the GRASS environment will be set to match the DEM extent and CRS.
A list of 'raster' objects representing input layers must be 
provided, as each layer will be written to the GRASS environment. 
For each input raster, a character vector of desired raster 
layer names must be provided. Both a accumulation and drainage 
direction raster are computed. A stream network is extracted,
using a simple accumulation threshold. For systems with limited
resources, the 'seg' parameter can be set to 'T" with a maximum 
RAM memory MB defined by 'memory_mb'.
